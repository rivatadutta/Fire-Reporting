# Report-Wildfires

## About
The app detects potential fires by crowdsourcing images of fires that users upload and using the image's data to draw vectors on a map. The intersection of these vectors can provide the likely point of a fire. Currently, the app is only implemented on android devices. A large scope of this project would be to increase functionality for first responders instead of only citizens.
